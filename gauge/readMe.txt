This simple code makes a custom OCX gauge.
Use the min, max, and value properties to customize your gauge.
The supplied tester project demonstrates how you may use the OCX.

You may use this code as a simple reference on how to use "property let"
and "property get" to give properties to your OCX.

Feel free to use this code however you wish...
